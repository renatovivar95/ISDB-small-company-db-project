# ISDB-small-company-db-project


This repository showcases the design and implementation of a **relational database system** for a veterinary hospital, developed for the **Information Systems and Databases Course** @ Instituto Superior Técnico.


## Project Overview

The project involves building a database system that models real-world entities and operations in a veterinary hospital setting, from animal ownership to medical procedures and diagnostics.

---

## Key Features

- Weak Entities: `animal`, `visit`, `weight`
- Specializations: `mammal → dog / cat / other`, `procedure → test / radiography / surgery`
- Mandatory and Disjoint Constraints
- Complete relational translation with `CREATE TABLE` + foreign keys
- Prescriptions, diagnostics, test indicators, and assistants included

---

## Environment Setup

This repository provides containerized services using **Docker Compose** to simplify the setup of all required tools and services for development and testing.

### Services Included



| Service     | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PostgreSQL  | Open-source relational database management system                           |
| pgAdmin4    | GUI for PostgreSQL administration and query execution                       |
| bdist/notebook | Jupyter Notebook Databases Stack (interactive DB notebooks with Python) |

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
